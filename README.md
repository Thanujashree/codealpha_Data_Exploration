Explore the structure of the Iris dataset, handle missing values, and visualize the data using plots and graphs to understand the distribution of each feature.

## Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project focuses on exploring the Iris dataset to gain insights into its structure and characteristics. Key tasks include loading the dataset, checking for missing values, and visualizing the data through various plots and graphs.

## Key Tasks

1. **Load the Iris Dataset:**
   - Use pandas to load the Iris dataset into the notebook for analysis.

2. **Check for Missing Values:**
   - Utilize pandas functions to identify and handle missing values if necessary.

3. **Visualize the Data:**
   - Use matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create visualizations such as pairplots and boxplots to understand the distribution of each feature.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-exploration-iris.git

markdown
Copy code

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
- Install Jupyter Notebook if not already installed: `pip install notebook`
- Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
- Open the `data-exploration-iris.ipynb` file in the browser.

3. **Run the Notebook:**
- Execute each cell in the notebook to perform data exploration tasks.

## Usage

- Analyze the structure of the Iris dataset and understand its features.
- Handle missing values if present to ensure data integrity.
- Visualize the data through plots and graphs to gain insights into feature distributions.
